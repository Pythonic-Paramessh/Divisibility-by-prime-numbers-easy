    <p class="myp">But there is an easier and better way to do it! It is called <strong>SEEDING.</strong>How excactly do you do seeding. You see, first you need to take a multiple of the divisor(prime) which ends with 1 or 9. If you prime divisor is 17, then 17 X 3 = <strong>51.</strong>Here is the important part. 51 can be written as 5 * 10 + 1. The number that is multiplied with 10 is the seed of the number. But before getting excited let us know the case of 9 too. Take 17 as the prime divisor again. 17 * 7 = <strong>119.</strong> so we can write 119 as: </p>
